## Overview

`cit` is a terminal-based interactive Git commit browser and checkout tool built with Go. It provides a convenient TUI (Text User Interface) for navigating through your Git repository's commit history and switching between commits and branches.

## Features

- Full-screen terminal UI powered by the `tview` library
- Browse and scroll through all commits in your Git repository
- View commit details including hash, date, author, and message
- Highlight the current HEAD position
- Display uncommitted changes
- Interactive branch selection when multiple branches point to the same commit
- Checkout commits with proper handling of both branch switching and detached HEAD states
- Automatic branch information caching for improved performance
- Real-time UI updates when Git state changes

## Usage

1. Navigate to a Git repository in your terminal
2. Run the `cit` command
3. Use arrow keys to navigate through commits
4. Press Enter on a commit to checkout
   - For commits with multiple branches, select the desired branch first
   - Confirm checkout with y/n
5. Press Escape to exit
